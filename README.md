# IllumioCodingAssignment
I have used the sample rules given in the coding question for generating rules and testing purposes.
Have uploaded the csv file(firewall.csv) I used for generating rules.

I have explained each function inside the code.

Due to shortage of time I could not cover few test cases, like validation of values while reading csv file.
Like, encountering a blank line, space or null values. IP address and port values less than 0 etc.
